## Manuscript Generator

pubsEngine is a [Haskell](https://haskell.org) application to convert Markdown markup formatted text file into several types of manuscripts.
It can convert into:

1. AASTeX formatted LaTeX document based on AASTEX63.cls from [American Astronomical Society](https://journals.aas.org/aastex-package-for-manuscript-preparation/)
1. Basic Springer Nature LaTeX document template following [this description](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/campaigns/latex-author-support)
2. Book format following [kaobook template](https://github.com/fmarotta/kaobook)
3. HTML Presentation following [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)
4. Thesis format following [Masters/Doctoral Thesis](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/masters-doctoral-thesis).

This application relies heavily on [Pandoc library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc).
You may consider this application as a merely extension/automation script for Pandoc.

This application extends the usage of several Markdown syntax, namely Image, CodeBlock classes, etc.
